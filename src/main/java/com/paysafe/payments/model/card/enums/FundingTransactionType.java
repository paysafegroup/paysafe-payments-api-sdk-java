/**
 * Enum representing the various processor applied types for funding transactions. The fundingTransaction processorAppliedType value is
 * chosen by Paysafe based on the merchant configuration. It is equal to the one which is used by Paysafe based on your MCC and registration.
 * If you  provide value which is applicable for your MCC but you have been registered for another use case, Paysafe will assign the value
 * you have registered for as use case and will provide it into the response as processorAppliedType. In case the merchant is not registered
 * in the relevant card scheme system, the processorAppliedValue received into the response will be 'NOT_APPLIED'.
 * The processorAppliedType can be seen in the auth response.
 *
 * <p>Enum Values:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>SVDW_FUNDS_TRANSFER:</strong> Stored Value Digital Wallet Funds Transfer.
 *   Used when a digital wallet is pre-loaded with funds using a Visa payment credential before transactions can occur.</li>
 *
 *   <li><strong>SDW_WALLET_TRANSFER:</strong> Staged Digital Wallet Transfer.
 *   Used for back-to-back funding transactions, allowing transactions even with insufficient funds in the wallet account.</li>
 *
 *   <li><strong>ACCOUNT_TO_ACCOUNT:</strong> Account to Account transfer.
 *   Refers to the transfer of money between two accounts, either at the same or different financial institutions.</li>
 *
 *   <li><strong>PERSON_TO_PERSON:</strong> Person to Person transfer.
 *   Refers to transferring funds between two individuals, typically outside of merchant transactions.</li>
 *
 *   <li><strong>NOT_APPLIED:</strong> Not processed as a funding transaction.
 *   This value is used when no funding transaction processor is applied or when the processor determines no application is relevant.</li>
 * </ul>
